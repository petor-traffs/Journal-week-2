# Journal-week-2 

As the last entry of my journal, the structure of it will be first about what I did in the week, the talks and meeting I had, and my opinion of them. Then, we'll get to the opinion I have of the videos that were due on this week! So, let's begin!

### October 5 

Starting the week well! I got into a meeting with my mentor, and he explained to me about Github...wow!! It’s an extremely useful tool, especially for projects where there’s a lot of people working on it. You have so many different options to work with, you can have a main branch of code, and have sub-branches of code so it can get merged in the main code.  I had the opportunity to listen the lightning talks, where the subjects were:
* Why Agile?
* GraphQL.
* Clean code.
* Unity.
* Why Machine Learning is dope.
* Thinking Hacks.

The one that got most of my attention was the Clean Code one. Here, you have to be able to write a code that everyone can read and understand. You’ll also need to give meaningful names for variables, functions and methods, so you know exactly what they mean. You can also apply the “One function, One task” concept. If you try to make big functions to make a lot of tasks, you’ll start forgetting what the function is doing, and you’ll have a bad time. Then, for the next advice, you have to make comments whenever you can, so you understand it better, and know exactly what is going on in that line of code. The last advice that they give you is to be consistent. What do I mean with this? Keep your way of writing code, your own style, throughout the project, so it’s easier to adapt to it, making it easier to read.

Another presentation that was very interesting to me was the Machine learning one. It’s such a vast subject to hop on, similar to Data Science. In fact, they have many things in common, but the difference is the tools that both subjects use. In the presentation, my teammate named just a few of these tools, all of which has its own difficulties when trying to learn, and even harder to apply them into a project.

Got into a pretty decent fight with myself about what language I should use for the programming problem. At first, I wanted Java, because I’ve been working on processing, and they have a tiny relation to the coding nature. I have to be honest, then I got scared with some examples I saw on how to properly use the program. Then I got more scared when I checked the other available programs (such as Rust). The reality is, I’m still a rookie, so naturally I will encounter many things that are unknown for me, but it doesn’t mean I should evade them...so I decided for Java: yes, it may be complicated, but after thinking about the situation, I got excited to use it...I hope I can keep that enthusiasm for the whole week.





### October 6
 
The meeting with my mentor was very interesting. The new concepts keep popping out on the questions, so I believe that there’s some hard work to do so I can get a hold of everything. 
I’ve got into the Lightning Talks with my teammates, starting with:
* SOLID
* React JS
* How internet works
* Microservices
* Parallel Programming
* OSI model

I personally liked the parallel programming part. It was so interesting!! You can have a problem, and get different resources to work on the same answer!! Many interrelated events happen at the same time, so this tool is very useful to these kinds of problems. You can save time and money. You can also solve larger problems, and take advantage of non-local resources. The downside is that it’s difficult to master it. It also has a lot of power consumption. Finally, you’ll get some issues when trying to “code tweak” your way out of the problem.

I also had the opportunity to advance in my Lightning Talk. There are so many different new subjects and concepts that I didn’t know about! All of them have fundamental details when talking about a specific topic. What I mean with this is that every little thing I can learn in this environment will help me understand even more things in the future, in an easier way. 

The codejam is sure an exciting problem, the only detail is that I’m no expert on Java. The process I did to solve the problem was the following: first, I understood the problem, what was the main question to answer. Then, in pseudo-code, I started to think how I could solve the different details that the problem gave. Lastly, I started the coding in a language that I fairly understand. Of course, it wasn’t java. At first, I managed to solve the problem in the most inefficient way. After that, at least I had a base to work on. So, after breaking my head, I believe I found an answer in a more efficient way. Right now, what I need to do is pass the code I have to Java, to see if I can make it work on that language too.

Lastly, going through the Coursera course, I’m finding that I have a lot to work on my learning abilities. There are so many wrong practices that can take on the wrong path of learning, and even worse, getting you into the path of procrastination and unfinished work.

### October 7

The Coursera course keeps getting better and better! The tools they explain to us are so easy to remember, and it makes a BIG difference between doing them and not doing them. One of the things that got into my head was about the focused and diffuse modes. Both of them “complement” each other, between the learning curve and the “solidification” process of that new knowledge. If you start to build your knowledge quickly, in a way that you don’t let the bricks of knowledge settle in your head, you will either forget about them or make a mess and confuse one thing with another.

Got the opportunity to work on the Java code! The problem was from CodeJam 2020, the Nesting Depth. It goes like this: 
Given a string of digits S, insert a minimum number of opening and closing parentheses into it such that the resulting string is balanced and each digit d is inside exactly d pairs of matching parentheses.
Let the nesting of two parentheses within a string be the substring that occurs strictly between them. An opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis that is further to its right are said to match if their nesting is empty, or if every parenthesis in their nesting matches with another parenthesis in their nesting. The nesting depth of a position p is the number of pairs of matching parentheses m such that p is included in the nesting of m.
Had to start with the logic of this problem first. After starting to find a path into it, I started to code. I got the Java language, and no, I’m no expert on the subject (yet), so I first tried to do it in a language that I could understand better. The program compiled just fine, so the only matter that was left was to actually get it in Java language. I broke my head a fair amount of time trying to make it work! What I got was a semi functional code, because when I tried it, it gave me some “extra” parentheses, so something is clearly wrong.




For the Lightning Talks, there were some repeated subjects, like Clean Code; nevertheless, there were many other subjects, like:
* Data Structures.
* APIs
* UX vs UI
* React 
* Time management: how to be productive
* Unit Testing

I believe that the React subject is a more general topic than the topic React JS that was previously presented.

From these subjects, Data structure was the most interesting (for me). It’s used to organize data in a particular way for particular types of operations. We have many different data structures. We begin with arrays, which are a list of values. Then we get the stacks, queues and lists, where they have dynamic data. We can also go to what dictionaries are: they store differently the data, because they can handle different kinds of data. We then go to Data Frames, they allow you to look for data through files and columns. Lastly, we get the Graph kind of data.

#### Operations in a day

Again, we got Julio as the main teacher! Now we’ll see what’s the daily activities in this department, what do the people in here do. They execute the defined strategy. While the company gets the objectives, this department focuses on how to make those objectives happen. Another activity about them is to check the work on the developers, see if you are doing the work correctly, or if you may be better in another team. This involves more details, but the main one is to make the individuals make great work, while having a good relationship with their clients.

#### Intro to labs (Monica Tye and Liliana Reyna)

It’s the place where the team creates products or software for Nearsoft (now Encora). Innovation is their core business and main source of revenue. They look for unique solutions, the products that can eliminate a problem, and that is doable (you could implement it in a short spawn of time). They normally look for Frontend, Backend, QA/Testing when talking about a product!


### October 8

I finally did it!! I solved the CodeJam problem!! At first I got into the code again, and I saw a detail on where I put the result string. I changed the place and now the output was correct, with all the correct parentheses. The new problem was when I put my code into the codejam page, for some reason, it just gave me a wrong answer. Luckily, my mentor knew the issue: the problem was that it would be an automated computer that would check my code, and my code had an output that the computer thought was the final answer, so obviously it gave me a wrong answer message.  We changed some details, erasing 2 lines of code, and after that, the code got my 2 green checkmarks, so my problem was good to go! We spent some time talking about my code, and what I could do to keep improving on my coding skills. We also had the opportunity to work a little on the Git app inside my IDE, so I’ll check more to it.







#### Safe spaces (Monica Lopez)

It’s a place or environment in which a person or category of people can feel confident that they will not be exposed to any emotional or physical harm. All of this is resumed in EMPATHY. We can start growing empathy by surrounding ourselves with other people, and become a group.

Remember, the individual shapes the group, and the group shapes the individual. Inside this company, there’s a “phrase” that goes like “the higher your freedom, the higher is your responsibility”. We need to have a good balance about this. 

Talking about the first part, in a group you need diversity, to form an “ecosystem”, if you will. Not because there are a lot of trees together, it makes them a forest. You need other factors, like animals, or flowers, even a river, to make it into a bigger forest, and thus, a better ecosystem, where everyone “helps” each other, by co-existing. The same goes for us!! We need diversity to keep growing! How can we keep growing? There are perspectives in almost everything, perspectives that may be different between person number 1 and person number 2.  These perspectives help seeing a problem from different angles, and maybe even details that you don’t see from your own point of view. Of course, just by having those different opinions is not enough to keep growing. It’s HOW you use these opinions, or how you adapt your own one to those, in how big and quickly you’ll be able to grow.

### October 9

Well, today my meeting with my mentor was short, so it gave me a good opportunity to polish the details of my presentation.  Not much has happened in the day, except for the fact that I learned how to make a pull request of a repository! Of course, this was with the help of my teammates, which I’m very grateful for. I’ve also got the opportunity to work with the HackerRank problem, which is a palindrome problem.
Luckily for me, I could use any language that I wanted, so I went with Python. It’s very interesting to keep learning different commands or syntax in a language, because they become new tools so you can work on.

## Videos
There were only videos in this weeks assignments. Even if they were transcripted, I put all of them here.

### Google I/O 2009 - The Myth of the Genius Programmer

When you get into a laboral life, no matter if you’re a programmer or a doctor or anything, you’ll always get the fear of having insecurity, and looking like an idiot in front of everyone, just for talking about an idea you had! Stop getting that fear, it’s not good for your health. The sooner you get your idea out, the sooner more people will look to it, and perhaps they’ll help.
We have to remember that we are not alone in any environment, we are surrounded  by people, intelligent people that are willing to help you, if the idea is right. By this, I mean that not every idea that you speak out loud will get the whole department involved, but as long as your group knows what ideas you have, some of them will be glad to help. In other words, look for cooperation. Not 1 GREAT idea has been coded by just 1 person. It’s about looking at the problem from different angles, different solutions to it.

How can I do that? Weel, there are some points that you may want to follow:
* Lose the ego.- Community is the essence of every project! So it’ll be better for you if you start to interact with them. Who knows, maybe you’ll like them, and while doing that, you’ll improve your social skills.
* Criticism isn’t evil.- No one likes to receive criticism, but most of us love to give it away. The key in this is to know HOW to give proper criticism, so that the other person doesn’t feel like you’re throwing knives at them.
* Embrace failure.-  If failure didn’t exist, we would get stuck so quickly. You want to fail, so you can learn something every time!
* Iterate quickly.- Referring to failure, try and fail quickly, so you can learn quickly.
* Practice is key.- As you keep practicing, you’ll get more failures BUT, these failures will get smaller each time, so keep an eye on that.
* Be a small fish.- No, do not stay on your size forever. What this means is that if you’re always the big fish in the pond, or the most experienced one, you won’t learn much from anyone. Maybe you will learn something, but it’ll be rare. The solution? Surround yourself with people who are better than you, and you’ll learn more, and quickier.
* Be influenced.- This goes both ways, know how to influence others, while learning how to be influenced by others. This is so you can listen to better ideas, without the prejudgement that you could have about something.
* Be vulnerable.- I may not be a fan of this one, at least its title. The lesson for this one is to show that you can change, if it’s necessary.

Now that we have this, we get into the evolution of your project. Remember, an initial idea can go into a prototype, so then you can involve more collaborators, and finally you can start coding your ideas. Be aware that you have to know WHEN to get cooperation. You should at least have YOUR objectives of YOUR project. And remember, never erase anything, all knowledge is good knowledge.
As a personal opinion of the duo that gives the video, they say that we should get 2, maybe 3 people into our project. With this number, the ideas that each individual has are listened by everyone: if you had a group of 40 people working on the same, ideas would get lost, redundant, etc.
So, to wrap it up, try and do this for your way of working:
* Don’t try to be a genius.
* Collaborate early and often.
* Pay attention to the tools that you are using in your project.
* Pay attention to the timing of the activities that you have.

Do all this, and people will think you’re a genius! (pretty ironic, huh?)

### #perfmatters

Alright, this one talks about the performance of a page, in a mobile if we’re being specific. So, before anything, how can we say that a page has good or bad performance? Well, you have to get this in your head: “What you can measure, you can optimize”. Now we can start! Just having information on your page, how it’s working, is not enough. To have a good “performance tuning”, you have to gather all the information that you can about anything associated with your project. After that, try and get some insight of the information, what can you do with it. Check if it’s helpful or if it’s going to occupy unnecessary space. Then, we go and take actions, based on the information that you gathered. This is perhaps the most difficult part of this, so we have to be careful. 
If you’ve managed to do this series of steps, then all you need to do is to repeat everything! You have more knowledge to work on, more experience, so these step will go faster. In this specific case, about the web performance, we get 3 basic pillars:
* Network.
* Render.
* Compute.

The network step is where you optimize critical paths (this means about what’s needed to get to the screen). Normally, there are a lot of actions going before we can even paint the first pixel into the screen.
The Render part talks about reducing the number of paints. This refers to the changes that are being made constantly in your page, if you’re receiving info from the client, if there’s an unexpected ad, etc.
Last but not least, we have the Compute part, where you need to reduce the JS execution time. There are time blocks, where you can do certain actions. If the actions that you need to do surpass the block they’re supposed to be, it’ll make your page feel “sticky”. 

All of these pillars have the basics, so we have to remember and try to make less requests before getting the first pixel (Network), always recalculate the rendering of your page (Render), and remember to use tools, not rules for your page (Compute).




### Variable Length Codes (Ep 1, Compressor Head)/ The LZ77 Compression Family (Ep 2, Compressor Head)/ Markov Chain Compression (Ep 3, Compressor Head)

These series of videos were a little complicated for me to understand, especially the last one, but here I am, trying to explain what I’ve seen. Here goes nothing!
You need to make your code as simple as possible. How can I do that? Well, every code is a combination of characters or symbols, so one way to do this is to assign the shortest code possible to the most frequent symbols; an example of something that is done with this method is the Morse code, with the letter E being the most used letter in the english language, getting the shortest code possible (a dot). Encoding something is the easy, and even fun part of this, the hard and perhaps tricky part is the decode of something, because you don’t know how to work on the numbers that are being given to you.
A common problem when decoding is that you’ll find that some symbols start with the same patterns, so you can’t use them, so it doesn’t get confusing. This is known as the prefix property.
There are hundreds of length codes, but  one of the most dominant is the next one:
Based on the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, it has become the most dominant dictionary encoding schemes in compression. It basically gives us a use of tokens, which give a “small array” that it can use to define parts of the code.
Another one that we can check in this kind of subjects is the Markov Chain algorithm. It takes an Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) approach to compression, by allowing the encoder and decoder to “predict” what data is coming next. This uses Variable Length Codes (VLC) to describe transitions. Be aware that this only works if you give the most probable symbol the smallest code work (similar to the Morse code).

### Google I/O 2012 - The Art of Organizational Manipulation

How can you navigate through your organization, without dying in the task? Well, first of all we have to learn how to differentiate an IDEAL company from a REALITY company, and how we can manipulate some things to work in our favor. We’ll look through the points ofone part and then another.

**Ideal organization**
* Your “boss” is a servant on leadership, it’ll make everyone efficient.
* You pursue responsibility, meaning that you will do things that you like and even do more!
* Question everything, without having someone to tell you to shut up, because your comments make them feel anxious.
* You communicate proactively with your team.
* You act like an adult (you make your work, without someone looking above your shoulder).
* You can get risks! This means that you can fail, adapt, and go again!

**Real organization**
* You have a bad boss, a bossy one. He also tends to be conservative, and doesn’t let you take any risk. This boss thinks that you serve him. Also, he/she completely ignores low performers.
* Be aware of the office politician, the one that looks for someone to take the blame.
* The expectations in this company are very unrealistic.
* The company doesn’t trust you.
* There’s directional chaos (many bosses, many ideas, many directions).

Sadly, most of the companies go into the “real” ones. But fear not!! Because there are some tips that you can use in a dysfunctional environment:
* Take risks. WARNING, don’t do something you can’t undo, or you’ll get in problems.
* Learn how to choose your battles, don’t try to get ALL of the activities.
* Give ideas, even if sometimes it’ll mean that you don’t take credit.
* Don’t destroy your habits, replace them!
* Get a good balance between decisions that’ll get you promoted and decisions that are correct actions for the company (in other words, learn how to work the ladder).
* Check the perception of your actions, how they’re seen outside your team, even from a superior.
* Use the favor economy (and don’t burn bridges).
* Make influential friends. 
* Get face to face with people so you can discuss.
* Learn how to ask anyone, anything. Be short, be concise!

Lots of steps, but just do them and you’ll see that everything will improve! And if not, there’s always plan B...Get out of there! Don’t play the victim here, if you can’t change something, you always have the option to leave for something better.

### Google I/O 2011: Programming Well with Others: Social Skills for Geeks   

This was a different video, one where there were a lot of examples of calls that the Duo in front had. It was actually very good to hear all these examples!
Remember, it’s always more important to present how you work as a team, more than how you present your genius. In other words, are you a team player?
There are many tips about how to work properly in a team, and the first of them is this: try to always get feedback with your team! This will help you to be more efficient, so you can be on the same page of the project. The way you’ll recruit your team may depend on how you are at work. What I mean is that you attract people who are similar to you, who have the same working “culture”, so perhaps you want to have an efficient culture. Talking about this, remember that it’s your project, so if you start seeing bad behaviour, even if it doesn’t look like one, but it interferes with your work, address it quickly.
Another good tip is to remember that everyone is in the same boat, in other words, everyone gets to lead the ship sometime in the project. Why? Because everyone has different ideas, so the course of your project can vary a little.

Now that you have your team all pumped and going, the next part goes with the clients. Try to connect with them, so you understand the needs that they have. With this, you’ll ensure to have a good relationship with them. At this point, you can also get the next one, which is to try and understand the most of a conversation, so you can explain and communicate better ideas to everyones.

### Developing Expertise: Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep

You have to wonder...if the technology keeps improving by the minute, why are we looking like a snail, in terms of going forward in software? It’s because software is written by people! The tools to do a software keep improving, but we as humans stay the same. So, we have to work on our teams to get a project going in the right direction.
Normally, in your team you have 2 types of person, the wizard and the novice. While the wizard is the most experienced one, and tends to explain everything, the novice doesn’t know much stuff. You could even be tempted to give the novice a label, right?
There’s the first error, you mustn't put labels, because they don’t stay forever. They’re not static, it’s a whole journey that goes in the expert path! These experiences are the ones that will help the novice turn into the next wizard, if the teams he/she is in can help him in a proper manner. Of course, the expert has a great intuition of everything, and that intuition comes with the experience he has, but how can a novice get there?
First of all, the teacher has to know that a novice will start with just wanting to know how to solve the problem. The novice doesn’t quite know everything in the subject he’s studying, so we have to give him short goals, so he feels accomplished and we don’t lose him in the way.  As he keeps going, he becomes an advanced beginner, where all of his focus goes to the activities he’s doing, so don’t interrupt him!

At some point, the novice (now advanced beginner) will think that he’s going backwards! Don’t be afraid of this, because it’s your transformation to being proficient! You start getting the bigger picture, and normally, you’ll start asking questions. Beware of this last point, because a lot of people will want to take you down because of that, because you question their decisions. Do not be discouraged by something like that. 
And, after all of this, the novice suddenly becomes an expert! Experts usually don’t follow rules, they follow their intuition, and it’s normally better than the rules. When you are on this level, you’ll feel like underestimating yourself, which is normal, because the more you know, the more you realize you don’t know. When going in this level, try and encourage competence, you can always develop some expertise by doing this.

Another important tip that you should be aware of is that repetition is not necessarily experience. It’s the correct PRACTICE that gives you experience (even a bad practice can give you experience, and you’ll learn quickier). And last but not least, always try to train for yourself, invest a minimum amount of time. The companies are not responsible to train you, it’s your own job to keep improving.

### CouchDB and Me

This was a somewhat weird talk to listen to. I’d even say that this was the video I enjoyed the less of all the other ones. Most of the video is how he managed to get his dream job, and what were the circumstances.  Yes, it was hard, having a baby to raise while not having a job is something that I assume must be beyond difficult. At first, he tried to see himself in a great job, one where you could have passion for something, while having the normal responsibilities. There were many reasons to look for that kind of job: for education purposes, so that you could keep growing in your expertise field, getting more family time. There even was the motivation of seeing what can you do, what are your limitations. All of this, goes to the last point, of having a good and interesting story to tell.

Of course, there were many problems along the way, in the development of CouchDB. You could say that there even was panic about it. Having a family, not having a job, needing to pay the bills, your savings go in a second. Luckily for him, he managed to find a job at MySQL. He worked there, while managing the development of CouchDB. Of course, the first 6 months or so weren’t about the development of his app, he spent those 6 months going through relearning some of the basic tools that he had to manage. In conclusion of his story, he is now the proud owner of a successful app. I believe the moral of the story is to work hard for that cool job that you have in your dreams.

### Perfection Is An Unrealistic Goal

This series of videos are given by the same lady, and she tries to make her point with the “agile methodology”.  You basically have to see yourself not as someone who works in an agile way, but someone who IS an agile person. You have to remember that the iterations don't automatically get you to the right place, you need good oriented practice. Why? Because sometimes even if you can define a goal, you don’t see a linear way to it.
Sometimes, the way to your main goal may not be achievable at the moment, but don’t panic, because that path will make you learn. What I mean is that, again, maybe you won’t get to your PERFECT goal, but you’ll be happy and comfortable with what you’ve been doing, so the best way to keep growing is to keep doing the same evolving path.

As we have seen in some other videos, or even in the Coursera course of learning how to learn, we have some thick hardwired heads on top of us. It can get difficult to change an idea or concept of your because of that. Luckily, there’s a method to work on this, and it involves your unconscious mind. Try and get some sleep, so that some of your thoughts can get into your hardwired head (this is an agile method, by the way). Don’t think that you’re slacking. We constantly think that being productive is working 8 straight hours without a break. Sometimes you just need a plan for working, having time for interrupted work and getting some breaks in between. In the video, it’s mentioned that 90 minutes of hard, uninterrupted work is a great stipulated time. I personally look forward to applying that period of time, and see how it goes!

To wrap it up, remember that working on your brain never ends! Try to prove your own effort, so you can prove yourself and check if the way you’re living is the correct one. Also, try and look for different things, interesting topics that you don’t know about, or an ability that you wish you had. Keep working on yourself, both physically and mentally!

### The Power of an Agile Mindset

The phrase which this video starts was beautiful for me, because it tries to start with a motivation. It basically says that “never let anything get in the way to your dream. You can do it!” Pretty powerful, huh? 
Of course, don’t think that just by repeating that to yourself, you will make your dream come true. You can always improve! Don’t think that you’re not intelligent enough, it’s just a label, and a toxic one! The true key to success is constant work. You can substitute intelligence with any ability or talent. Step by step, you can get better, you just need the correct practice for it!

Following the last idea, you also need to know this: do not believe that you either have it or not. I mean about intelligence or abilities, it’s not that you were born with it or not! Always look to learn more and more, always look to see if you can improve something. Don’t get labelled with things like “he’s intelligent, he’ll manage a way” or “he’s so talented because his dad/mom was good in the subject”. Yes,  we all start in different conditions, and some conditions are better than others. It doesn’t matter where you come from, what does matter is where you’re trying to go, and how you’ll do it. For that, just keep working hard, and you’ll start to enjoy the challenges in front of you. You’ll also feel less and less discouraged by phrases like “you can’t do it”
A good tip for this is to try and always look up, not down. Look for people who are better than you, so you can improve! Of course, if you “look down” is so you can help someone who is in a similar situation like yours.

Remember, try to have an agile mentality, where you:
* Can constantly grow.
* Always want to learn.
* Embrace any challenge given to you.
* Failure just gives you valuable information on how to get better.
* Your effort is your own path to master something.
* You feel RESILIENCE to any challenge.

Something that you can also start working on is in the teams section. DO NOT stereotype with any little information that you’ve been given. Also remember that both managers and teammates have different types of mindset; there are no perfect relationships or people, you just have to correctly adapt yourself.

If you still are not convinced with all of this agile mindset, then...I’m afraid to tell you that you were born with it. That’s right, since we’re babies, we learn by practicing, we’re not born and instantly talk about a subject. We first learn how to talk, then we start articulating words, the phrases. Start doing a series of steps and you end up speaking in front of a 200 audience about your next application! Remember, step by step you’ll get far, but always put some effort, strategies and process into it, so the path is a little easier.
To close this section, I’ll remind you of this: fail early, so you can fail often and then learn often. Failure IS an option, don’t see it as a prohibited word in you vocabulary. If there was no failure, how can we learn? And lastly, we’re a constant work in progress, so try and build constantly on yourself.

### Collaboration, Bonobos and The Brain

We’ve evolved to behave in certain ways, and this has influenced the structure of our brains. Sometimes, it’s difficult to teach something, maybe because the other person is just so stubborn that it’ll not hear you. Or maybe, you cannot communicate your ideas well enough. A good tip to teach something is to outline the logical reasons for why this is a good thing to learn. Of course, you may end up with the same “no” answer, but you at least give a good argument so that the other person can properly process it, and who knows, perhaps it’ll change their mind.
Get in mind that an unconscious mind is very powerful, it knows an enormous amount of things. You just have to let it work on its own. How can you take advantage of that? Gather a lot of information, try to analyze it, and when you get sleepy, it’ll be the turn for the unconscious part to work.The transcript was somewhat weird, because it talks a lot of examples of the bonobos group. But you can actually get a valuable tip from those examples. The first one would be that bonobos work as a team to work better, so we can apply this information to our own teamwork. 

### Prejudices Can Alter Team Work

This transcript was similar to the last one, where Linda uses examples to get to the point. The main idea that we get is that prejudices can alter teamwork, so it’s best if you leave your labels at home. It’s hard, I know, because we’re hardwired to be very judgmental. But at the end of the day, we’re all the same, I don’t care about anything else, we just need a common objective to work together. Remember to leave your labels,  because a stereotype will make you make a comment or an opinion, and that opinion may affect the ones you’re judging. I may have to rephrase myself: if you have to stereotype, make sure it’s a good one, because that will positively affect the behaviour of everyone in the group. In other words, try to look for the good part of someone.

### Everything is a remix

I was impressed by the start of the video. As the title says, all the new ideas part from older ideas. I was astonished to see that an original idea may have had something in common with the past! Maybe remixes exist because we like known things, we are scared of unknown things. Having that in mind, we go into the original ideas, which they appear to not be so original after all! Every song, movie, book that may seem original, it’s actually based on a template. Of course, some of the greatest original ideas don’t rely on just 1 source to base upon, the geniuses behind those works tend to use a lot of sources for their own ideas.
I’m not saying that we don’t have original ideas anymore, it’s the concept of original that we have wrong. Since ancient times, ideas have been based on older ideas, either if that base was a big idea or not, is a different subject, but everything has bases to work on.Where does creativity come from? It comes from applying ideas to existing things.
Don’t feel bad for this, we tend to copy, it’s our way of learning. How does a baby start to talk? By mimicking their parents. The same can be applied to other subjects. First, we have to understand things, by copying them. When we get a good hold of this, then we can start getting original, by basing our knowledge on past ideas. The basic elements of creativity (and evolution for that matter), are the copy part, the transform part, and the combine part.

Sadly, we’re getting into a problem here, where it’s hard to get ideas without getting the tag of “ripout”. Also get in mind that if you don’t make a breakthrough, someone else will, it’s called “multiple discovery”.
Going back to the ripout part, the ideas are getting sold (intellectual rights), and thus, the copyright invention starts to get some issues. This opens the door to sue and get some easy money, where now our ideas don’t belong to us, and we can’t mimic anything in the world because we’ll get sued. We’re taking the fundamental part of science out of it, by not leting reproduce our results: we need to start spreading our ideas again, so they can become the bases of even brighter ideas.

### Missing semester: Shell tools and scripting

I cannot say a lot of this video/lecture, because it is mostly so you can practice in the shell. It tells us that spaces do matter here, so you have to be careful while doing the exercises in here. This just keeps giving us more commands to learn! And I intend to keep doing that. This one and the last lesson I used mostly the lecture that was below the video, but I think I will start to check on the videos too, they tend to be more interactive, or at least I can see what is going on with the commands that the user is putting.

 
This is everything from my part, if you have any doubt, or want to ask for something, just let me know!
